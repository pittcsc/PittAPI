The Pitt API is an unofficial Python API made by Ritwik Gupta at the University of Pittsburgh in an effort to get more open data from Pitt.

## Installation

PittAPI requires Python 3.13. Add the published package to a uv-managed project with:

```sh
uv add pittapi
```

To work on PittAPI itself, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), clone this repository,
and create the locked development environment:

```sh
uv sync --locked
```

Run Python and project tools inside that environment with `uv run`, for example `uv run python`.

## Usage examples

```python
from pittapi import course, dining, lab, laundry, library, news, people, shuttle, textbook

### Courses
# Returns a dictionary of all courses for a given subject
cs_subject = course.get_subject_courses(subject='CS')
courses_dict = cs_subject.courses

# Returns a list of sections of a course during a given term
cs_course = course.get_course_details(term='2244', subject='CS', course='1501')
section_list = cs_course.sections

### Textbook
# Returns a list of dictionaries containing textbooks for a class
# Term number comes from pitt.verbacompare.com
small_dict = textbook.get_textbook(term="3150", department="CS", course="445", instructor="RAMIREZ")

### Library
# Returns a dictionary containing results from query
big_dict = library.get_documents(query="computer")

### News

# total washers and dryers in building
small_dict = laundry.get_status_simple(building_name="TOWERS")

### Computer Lab
# Returns a dictionary with status of the lab and number of open machines
small_dict = lab.get_status(lab_name="ALUMNI")

### Shuttle
# Returns a list of dictionaries containing routes of shuttles
big_dict = shuttle.get_routes()

### People
# Returns a list of people based on the query
list_of_peeps = people.get_person(query="Smith")
